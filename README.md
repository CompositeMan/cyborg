You can also use an environment variable in the path setting using the syntax ${env:VARIABLE}. For example, if you've created a variable named PYTHON_INSTALL_LOC with a path to an interpreter, you can then use the following setting value:
"python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${env:PYTHON_INSTALL_LOC}",

Note: Variable substitution is only supported in VS Code settings files, it will not work in .env environment files.

Use argparse
Use a config file for defaults?
